# CS50_projects

Contains all of my projects from the CS50 course from the university of Harvard

Week 1 to 5 where all about learning the basic building blocs of programming trough the lens of the C language. I learned about algorithms, data structures, ...

Week 6 was all about learning how to apply all our knowledge to a new language, Python. And also learning that with a new language comes a lot of new features and ways to do what we already know differently.

Week 7 is an introduction to relational database with SQLite3.

Week 8 is an introduction of Web Programming with a tour of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Week 9 is all about putting everything we've learned so far and making a web app with it. All this using the python framework Flask to tie everything.
